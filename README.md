# lotto-algorithm
## simple lotto drawing simulation algorithm written in c++ 

### what features does it have
1. Validation of the range of the typed number
2. Validations of the typed int - string value
3. Unable to enter the given number again
4. Repeatless drawing.
5. Counting points

### future updates
1. adding a new "at-random" method of drawing
2. code optimization using functions
